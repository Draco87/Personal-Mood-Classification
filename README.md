# üìä Personal Mood Analysis & Prediction Project

A data science project that transforms messy, real-world personal mood tracking data into actionable insights. This project analyzes daily habits like sleep, study, exercise, and hydration to discover which factors have the most significant impact on mood.

---

## ‚ú® Overview

The goal of this project is to apply a full data science workflow to a personal dataset. It demonstrates:

- How to handle common data quality issues
- How to perform insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- How to build a predictive model to uncover underlying patterns

**Key Insight:** Identify the most influential drivers of mood from daily logged data.

## üöÄ Project Workflow

This project follows a complete, end-to-end data science pipeline:

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning

- Loads data directly from an `.xlsx` file (avoids CSV parsing issues)
- Cleans and standardizes column data
- Handles missing or inconsistent values using methods like interpolation and median filling

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Performs visual analysis to understand relationships between variables
- Generates plots for:
  - Mood distribution
  - Correlations between habits
  - Impact of each habit on mood

### 3. Predictive Modeling

- Trains a `RandomForestClassifier`, a powerful ensemble model
- Learns complex, non-linear patterns linking daily habits to mood outcomes

### 4. Insight Generation

- Extracts feature importances from the trained model
- Quantifies the relative impact of each habit on mood
- Provides a clear, data-driven conclusion on predictive power

## üß† Key Insights Uncovered

After analyzing the personal dataset, the model identified the following hierarchy of influence on mood:

- **Most Important Factor:** Sleep ‚Äî the single most significant predictor
- **Second Most Important:** Study hours ‚Äî strong correlation with mood changes
- **Lesser Impact:** Exercise and Hydration ‚Äî still relevant, but smaller impact on predictions

üëâ _Suggestion: Replace this section with a link to the "Feature Importance" chart generated by the script for visual clarity._

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Project

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. Then install required libraries. You can use the following `requirements.txt` file:

```txt
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
openpyxl
```
### 2. Prepare Your Data
Create an Excel file named ```mood tracker.xlsx``` in the same directory as the script.

Ensure it has columns like ```Mood```, ```Study```, ```Exercise```, ```Hydration```, etc. The script is designed to be flexible with missing columns or data.

### 3. Run the Analysis
Execute the Python script from your terminal:

```python mood_classification.py```

The script will print the cleaning steps, generate EDA plots, and finally output the feature importance results before displaying the final summary chart.
